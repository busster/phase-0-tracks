- enter a word
	- split word into an array 'secret_word'
		- get length of array 'secret_word'
- build new array 'guess_word' filled with _'s from length of array
- guess count can't exceed length
- iterate through array 'secret_word' |i|
	- if input == char 
		- set 'guess_word'[i] = 'secret_word'[i]



* will have to handle lower vs upper case letters



get input
while secret_word.length < guess count || guess_word != secret_word
	check if letter is in secret_word
		if it is change the letter in the guess_word
			add letter to guesses
		if not add letter to guess
